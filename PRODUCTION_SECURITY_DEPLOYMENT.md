export JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret"
export NODE_ENV="production"

# Verify environment variables
node -e "
console.log('Environment check:');
console.log('NODE_ENV:', process.env.NODE_ENV);
console.log('GUARDIAN_MASTER_KEY:', process.env.GUARDIAN_MASTER_KEY ? '‚úÖ Set' : '‚ùå Missing');
console.log('JWT_SECRET:', process.env.JWT_SECRET ? '‚úÖ Set' : '‚ùå Missing');
"
```

### **Step 3: Security Testing**

```bash
# Run security tests before deployment
npm run test:security

# Verify all security endpoints
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer test-token" \
     https://your-domain.com/api/security/status

# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -w "%{http_code}\n" https://your-domain.com/api/auth/login
done
```

### **Step 4: Monitoring Setup**

```bash
# Enable security monitoring
# 1. Configure log aggregation (ELK Stack/Splunk)
# 2. Set up security dashboards
# 3. Configure alerting for critical events
# 4. Test incident response procedures
```

## üìä SECURITY MONITORING

### **Real-Time Security Dashboard**

```typescript
// Access security status at:
GET /api/security/status
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>

// Response includes:
{
  "status": "secure",
  "metrics": {
    "rateLimiting": { /* rate limit stats */ },
    "authentication": { /* auth stats */ },
    "threats": { /* threat detection stats */ },
    "systemHealth": { /* system health */ }
  },
  "alerts": [ /* active security alerts */ ],
  "recommendations": [ /* security recommendations */ ]
}
```

### **Security Alerts Configuration**

```javascript
// Critical security events that trigger alerts:
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS attack attempts  
- Failed authentication spikes
- Rate limit violations
- Suspicious IP activity
- Data breach attempts
- System errors
```
