# Error Prevention Guidelines

## Critical Rules
1. Always use try-catch blocks for async operations
2. Never use eval() or dangerouslySetInnerHTML without sanitization
3. Always add cleanup functions to useEffect hooks with subscriptions
4. Use TypeScript strict mode and avoid 'any' type

## Best Practices
1. Use error boundaries in React components
2. Implement proper error handling in API routes
3. Add comprehensive tests for critical paths
4. Use ESLint and TypeScript for static analysis

## Automated Checks
- Pre-commit hooks run error detection
- CI/CD pipeline includes comprehensive testing
- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- Performance monitoring and alerting
