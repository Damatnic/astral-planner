# Claude Code Project Notes

## CRITICAL: Node.js Process Management
**DO NOT KILL NODE.JS PROCESSES WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER REQUEST**

- This project runs alongside multiple other projects
- Killing Node.js processes can break running applications
- Always check with user before terminating any processes
- Use `npm run dev` or similar commands to start development servers
- Let user manage process lifecycle unless specifically asked to intervene

## Development Commands
- Check package.json for available scripts
- Ask user for lint/typecheck commands if not found in package.json

## Testing
- Verify test framework before assuming testing approach
- Check README or search codebase for testing patterns

**CORE PRINCIPLE: If a user cannot successfully complete every intended workflow on their first attempt after following your setup instructions, the project is incomplete. No exceptions.**

## PROJECT DELIVERY STANDARDS

Every project must include:
