   `C:\Users\damat\_REPOS\ASTRAL_PLANNER\src\app\api\goals\route.ts`  
   - Currently: Empty file
   - Needs: Full CRUD operations, progress tracking

2. **Habits API Missing Implementation**  
   `C:\Users\damat\_REPOS\ASTRAL_PLANNER\src\app\api\habits\route.ts`  
   - Currently: Empty file  
   - Needs: Habit CRUD, streak calculations, logging

3. **Templates API Missing Implementation**  
   `C:\Users\damat\_REPOS\ASTRAL_PLANNER\src\app\api\templates\route.ts`  
   - Currently: Empty file
   - Needs: Template marketplace, instantiation logic

4. **Export API Missing Implementation**  
   `C:\Users\damat\_REPOS\ASTRAL_PLANNER\src\app\api\export\route.ts`  
   - Currently: Empty file
   - Needs: Multi-format data export (JSON, CSV, Markdown)

### **Priority 2: Task API Import Issues**
**Status**: 🟠 HIGH - Database operations will fail

**File**: `C:\Users\damat\_REPOS\ASTRAL_PLANNER\src\app\api\tasks\route.ts`  
**Issue**: Missing critical imports for user operations and activity logging  
**Fix**: Add imports and implement proper database relations

### **Priority 3: Frontend Component Gaps**  
**Status**: 🟠 HIGH - Users will see blank/broken pages

1. **Dashboard Page**: Exists but shows only placeholder text
2. **Analytics Page**: Empty component, no data visualization  
3. **Settings Page**: Basic layout, no functionality
4. **Onboarding Flow**: Page exists but no guided setup

- ✅ Proper normalization and indexing
- ✅ Comprehensive foreign key relationships  
- ✅ Flexible JSON fields for complex data
- ✅ Audit trails and soft deletes
- ✅ Multi-tenant architecture support
- ✅ Scalable analytics and reporting structure

### **Component Architecture Assessment**
- ✅ Good separation of concerns between UI and business logic
- ✅ Proper TypeScript interfaces for component props
- ✅ Reusable component patterns
- ⚠️ Some components have complex logic that could be extracted to hooks
- ⚠️ Missing error boundary implementations
- ⚠️ Limited accessibility features in custom components

✅ **HTTPS**: Enforced through Vercel deployment  
⚠️ **Input Sanitization**: Needs enhancement for user-generated content  
⚠️ **Rate Limiting**: Not implemented for API endpoints  
❌ **Security Headers**: Partial implementation in vercel.json  

### **Compliance Requirements**
- [ ] GDPR compliance for EU users (data export/deletion)
- [ ] CCPA compliance for California users  
- [ ] SOC 2 considerations for enterprise customers
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Data retention policies and implementation
